# Odo Accuracy

Checking the accuracy of our odo pods when rotating

5 rotations = 5 circumferances = $10 \pi r$

421081 -> Radius is calculated as 13403 ticks
103964 -> Radius is calculatee as 3309 ticks

TicksPerRev = 8192
WheelRadius = 17.5 mm

Observed Radius is 1.63611 encoder revolutions
Observed Radius is .404 encoder revolutions

A revolution is $35\pi$ mm

Observed Radius is 179.9 mm
Observed Radius is 44.4 mm

For distance, recall that $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$
thus:
$x^2 + y^2 = 13403^2 = 179640409$
$x^2 + y^2 = 3309^2 =  10949481$

Metal chassis is 31.2cm wide
The drivebase axles are 33.6cm apart

Measured "outer" pod is 17.8cm x 5.2cm from center
Measured "inner" pod is 7.6cm x 4.9cm from center

#### Turning "error" (slippage on my floor):
Outer pod -> 0.55cm radius, or about 3% error
Inner pod -> 4.6cm radius, or about 104% error
